    "description" : "In a mysterious universe, an elite defense force of peace and justice have existed for centuries. Cocky test pilot Hal Jordan acquires superhuman powers when he is chosen by \"the Ring\", the willpower-fed source of power, of the Green Lantern Corps. Reluctantly at first, he takes on the challenges these other superheroes face. Putting his self-doubts aside, and spurred on by his sense of duty and love for his beautiful, intellectually equal, colleague, Carol Ferris, he is soon called to defend mankind from Parallax, a powerful, evil being who feeds on fear. He is the universe's last chance, as many Green Lanterns have been killed and the Corps is weakened. And he might just be the right Green Lantern for the job of keeping the world safe from harm. Based on the characters of DC Comics series \"Green Lantern\". Written by Warner Bros. Pictures",
