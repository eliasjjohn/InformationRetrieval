    "description" : "Two years have passed since Carrie Bradshaw finally bagged John \"Mr. Big\" Preston, the man she was always meant to be with. Just as her friend Charlotte must deal with her young daughter's \"terrible two's\", Carrie must deal with her relationship taking a turn for the worse - Big likes to watch old black-and-white movies on TV and eat take-out food, which prevents Carrie from feeling like the free-wheeling party girl she used to be. Meanwhile, Miranda copes with a new boss that can't handle an intelligent, powerful woman, and Samantha works a public relations angle that gets the fashionable foursome an all-expense-paid trip to Abu Dhabi. Written by The Massie Twins",
