    "description" : "As the Greeks fall, they decided to head back home. King Priam decides to have one last battle with the Greeks to leave Troy for good. It was a night battle so the Greeks didn't knew, raining them down with flaming arrows and lighting huge balls of dry branches and rolling them down at the beach. It was a battle that Achilles wasn't in, but his cousin Patroclus pretended to be him by wearing his armor, his sword, his helmet, and his moves. Hector finally had a battle with Achilles not knowing it wasn't him. Patroclus was fast but Hector was faster, causing him to cut Patroclus's neck and finishing him with a sword to the heart.
