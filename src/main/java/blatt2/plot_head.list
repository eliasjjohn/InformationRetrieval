PL: and then are locked in an isolation booth. The couple has 60 seconds to

MV: "'Allo 'Allo!" (1982)

PL: René Artois runs a small café in France during World War II. He always
PL: seems to have his hands full: He's having affairs with most of his
PL: waitresses, he's keeping his wife happy, he's trying to please the German
PL: soldiers who frequent his café, and he's running a major underground
PL: operation for the Resistance. Quite often, the Germans' incompetence itself
PL: is what nearly lands René and his cohorts in hot water; they are not helped
PL: either by the locals, who are dreadfully keen to get rid of the Germans,
PL: but their blatant and theatrical attempts at espionage and secrecy often
PL: create problems that René must solve quickly.

BY: Murray Chapman <muzzle@cs.uq.oz.au>

PL: René Artois is the owner and manager of a café in German-occupied France of
PL: World War II. To look at him, it's hard to believe that some women find him
PL: irresistible, something he has to work hard to hide from his wife Edith.
PL: René's café, frequented by both the German military and the French
PL: resistance, is the focal point for the show. René's a bit of a coward and
PL: is stuck in the middle, trying to humor both sides. Hidden in the café are
PL: two English airmen who don't understand a word of French. Other characters
PL: include Lt. Gruber, a homosexual German tank driver; Otto Flick, the evil
PL: SS officer who is always outsmarted; and Engelbert von Smallhausen, his
PL: small sidekick. René's not the only coward in town: Captain Hans Geering
PL: and Colonel Kurt von Strohm are constantly on the defensive, along with
PL: Captain Alberto Bertorelli of the Italian army who has a medal for
PL: servicing Fiats. Much of the farce comes from Officer Crabtree, an British
PL: agent disguised as a French policeman with a poor grasp of "Zee Fronch
PL: Linguige," and from René's amorous waitresses, Mimi, Yvette, and Maria.

BY: Rob Hartill

PL: In this spoof of World War II, René Artois runs a café in German-occupied
PL: France. He is also an unwilling agent of the Germans, mostly under the
PL: command of Col. Kurt von Strohm, and of the French Resistance, under the
PL: command of Michelle Dubois ("Listen very carefully; I shall say this only
PL: once"). René is married to aged Edith, who is the worst singer in the
PL: world, but he finds that young women find him sexy. Most of the plots
PL: include planning the murder of the local commanding German officer, General
PL: Erich von Klinkerhoffen, as well as the ownership of a painting called "The
PL: Fallen Madonna with the Big Boobies"--a painting that everybody would love
PL: to get their hands on to sell after the war. He has also two downed idiot
PL: British airmen who, as time goes by, are impossible to get rid of. The main
PL: opposition is the insane SS officer Otto Flick. René tries to complete the
PL: German and the Fench Resistance's plans, even though he's a coward and
PL: wonders if he's going to get out of the war alive.

PL: only lead is a virologist (Dr. Cassandra Railly), who knows the dangerous
PL: source of the outbreak.

PL: James Cole travels back in time from 2043 to 2013 in the hopes of stopping
PL: the outbreak of a deadly disease that has its origins in 2017. He kidnaps
PL: virologist Dr. Cassandra Railly but quickly realizes they have sent him too
PL: far back in time as she has yet to meet a key player in the timeline,
PL: Leland Frost. She thinks he's insane but he quickly demonstrates how the
PL: timeline can be changed and then promptly vanishes before her very eyes.
PL: They meet again in 2015 where he tells her that in 2017, the plague killed
PL: most of the world's population, 7 billion people. Cole's mission is find
PL: away to stop the plague from happening in the first place - and that she
PL: mentioned his name in a radio message before she died. Leland Frost has
PL: been found but his name is actually Leland Goines, CEO of the Markridge
PL: Group which engages in various Defense Department activities. When they
PL: finally do meet up, Goines recalls meeting meeting Cole in 1987 - but Cole
PL: is certain he hasn't met him yet. It quickly becomes clear that Goines
PL: isn't the cause of the plague.

PL: "Mr. Cole is the priority, then we worry about the core," Jones tells her
PL: team in tonight's episode. She's speaking of the tracer signal: Staying
PL: locked on Cole, tracking him in time and space, is the single most
PL: important task. All future missions rely upon calling him back, and that
PL: need eclipses all others, including the need to preserve the machinery. But
PL: it functions as a metaphor for the show as well. Stay locked on Cole and
PL: the story stays strong. Lose sight of him and it falters. The characters
PL: and emotional arcs of 12 Monkeys have stumbled over its eight episodes, but
PL: the story mechanics stayed strong. The show has clearly conveyed the
PL: potentially confusing jumps through time and space with seemingly
PL: effortless focus, and kept the larger narrative free of distractions by
PL: keeping everything centered tightly around James Cole. Until tonight.
PL: "Yesterday" inverts most of the expectations the series has established,
PL: not entirely successfully. Cole spends his scant minutes of the episode in
PL: a dark cellar while his compatriots from 2043 leave their shadowy
PL: time-travel bunker for the sunny, spacious halls of Spearhead, a
PL: longstanding post-plague institute searching for a cure to the constantly
PL: mutating virus. Years ago, Col. Foster (Xander Berkeley) staged a coup,
PL: assassinating the world's military and political leaders when they proposed
PL: to abandon medical research in favor of retreating to isolation. His teams
PL: have harvested every hard drive, server, and processor within 500 miles,

PL: Spearhead is run by Col. Jonathan Foster and is dedicated to finding a cure
PL: to virus. He clearly doesn't have much faith in Jones' project to change
PL: the past. When Jones tries to bring Cole back, she damages the Core beyond
PL: repair. There is only one place to find a replacement. In 2015, it's the
PL: week of the Chechnya explosion. Cole's body was never found in the debris

PL: This story is based not-to-loosely upon the real experiences of the crew of
PL: Frenesi, captained by William "Pappy" Cely, flying out of Rougham Field,
PL: Bury St Andrews. Though the sketch in general is a composite of any B-17's
PL: crew at the time, there are unarguable parallels to the Frenesi story,
PL: specifically, the mission to Brunswick on 2/11/44. Cely and his crew flew
PL: an inordinate number of missions; more certainly than the required 25. Cely
PL: flew Frenesi and her crew on this critical mission to bomb a ball bearing
PL: factory in Brunswick this day. The formation received heavier than usual
PL: flak and suffered gravely. Upon approaching target, dense, but intermittent
PL: low fog made dispatch questionable and the SOP would have been let fly and
PL: high tail it, but Pappy opted for a go-round, and re-approach to minimize
PL: collaterals. There was a school, see. Well Frenesi took a lot of heat; she
PL: was very badly damaged, but she was rewarded with a break in the fog to
PL: allow her to precisely dispense her load. She rattled back to Rougham, held
PL: together by her skin alone; her structure being later deemed "the most
PL: heavily damaged bird to safely land". She was a miracle, and Cely a saint.

PL: Eagle. When Pridie gives Eagle an especially dim appraisal, threatening his

PL: mission, his plane is shot down with the loss of his entire crew. This
PL: earns him a reputation as a jinx, and Gallagher restricts him to non-pilot
PL: duties. On a subsequent mission, Dula takes umbrage at critical remarks

PL: Stovall. Dula demands that an entry be made to the log noting Komansky's
PL: "mutiny". Later, Komansky comes into possession of a letter from another
PL: survivor of Dula's previous mission who is in a POW camp in Germany that

PL: bomber fleet, and to some like her flight engineer, Sgt. Willets, she even
PL: seems to have a soul (and mind) of her own. Her endurance has earned her

PL: and return her to the States for a life of leisure as a recruiting icon.
PL: But Angel Babe seems to have other ideas, as she suddenly develops a
PL: multitude of mechanical ailments that thwart that final-mission goal. Not

PL: on fuel. Unfortunately, they are forced to use an airfield that has only
PL: just been liberated from the Germans by a motley group of Allied units

PL: Army vs. Navy - 1944. The 918th is picked to assist the Navy in an
PL: operation to find and destroy a German U-boat wolfpack operating in the
PL: Atlantic. Gallagher is concerned to learn that he will be working with and
PL: taking orders from Commodore Crompton, an old nemesis of his father.
PL: Crompton is even more upset by the arrangement, but grudgingly accepts the
PL: pact in order to recharge his failing career. Gallagher becomes incensed
PL: when he learns that his planes are not to carry bombs in order to maximize
PL: flying time. They are simply to spot the enemy and guide the Navy to the
PL: kill. However, the strategy doesn't work quite as planned, and the
PL: animosity between Crompton and Gallagher comes to an explosive head.

PL: with his crew and bomber as replacements. Gallagher is glad to see him, but
PL: McGraw pulls some reckless stunts because he has always felt overshadowed
PL: by Gallagher and wants to make a name for himself. As his exploits grow to

PL: causes his bomber to crack up on takeoff, killing or injuring several

PL: When Gen. Savage's plane is shot down by a German Trojan horse (a captured
PL: B-17) pretending to be a straggler, Joe Gallagher, by now a colonel, takes
PL: over temporary command of the 918th. As a reluctant candidate for permanent
PL: status, he must face the withering scrutiny of General Britt, as well as
PL: his own feelings of inadequacy. As if that's not enough to handle, he also

PL: Every series deserves at least one good spooky episode, and this is it for
PL: 12o'H. The Lorelei is a bomber that returns from a mission and lands
PL: intact, but with its entire crew dead. Gen. Savage assigns the plane to his
PL: new 2nd-in-command, Col. Royce, who he's supposed to evaluate for
PL: assignment as a group commander. Royce is a highly-experienced, decorated,
PL: and well-liked pilot with one apparent flaw; he's decidedly superstitious,

PL: General Savage decides to court martial a pilot, Captain Ritchie, who
PL: disobeyed a direct order and left the bomber formation to protect a friend,
PL: Lt. Lockridge, and his crew who have bailed out of their crippled B-17.
PL: Because everyone else considers Ritchie a hero, Savage's severe action
PL: instigates a fall in morale and hostile feelings among his men. Savage must
PL: convince his troops that while Ritchie's deed may have saved the lives of
PL: the 7 men, it also jeopardized the security of the remaining 200 men in the
PL: Group. This is especially difficult for Lockridge, who must weigh his
PL: gratitude to his friend against the inescapable reality of Savage's
PL: argument.

BY: alexk-6

PL: The action appears entirely justifiable; Captain Wade Ritchie leaves the
PL: returning bomber formation, which is under fire over the English Channel,
PL: to fight off enemy planes heading for the parachuting crew of Lt. Tom
PL: Lockridge's destroyed bomber. But Savage, who'd given orders that no one
PL: was to leave formation, demands a court martial for Wade, a medal for Lt.
PL: Lockridge. Wade's defense is he and Lockridge are friends, would do the
PL: same for him. Savage doesn't think young Lt. Lockridge, who plans to marry
PL: a pretty nurse, Lt. Libby MacAndrews, and make the Air Force his career,
PL: would disobey orders for anyone. Savage is shunned by everyone for his
PL: insistence on going by the book and is in danger of having to answer
PL: embarrassing questions when Lockridge decides to turn down his medal. But
PL: Wade's gunner, wounded in the disputed action, dies in hospital and
PL: everyone suddenly sees Wade had no right to risk his crew to save
PL: Lockridge. Savage is proved right all around when Wade panics in the next
PL: action while flying co-pilot with Savage who is wounded, Wade calls over
PL: the radio to Lockridge to come to his rescue. Lockridge coolly refuses and
PL: Savage, despite his serious shoulder wound, is left to take the plane he
PL: and Wade are in to safety.

PL: the elusive objective - as long as he goes along for the ride. Although his

PL: multi-service commando mission aimed at knocking out the enemy facilities
PL: and stealing the technology for study. The undertaking is put at grave
PL: risk, however, by a combination of poor coordination between the different

PL: gains a reputation as an arrogant, by-the-book officer who has no interest
PL: in making friends or participating in the camaraderie of the Group. His
PL: dubious standing is seriously worsened when he is apparently the only

PL: disappeared in the States years before. Desperate for qualified crewmen,
PL: General Savage is unconvinced of Moran's allegation and demands concrete
PL: proof. In the meantime, Moran continues to hound Driscoll in hopes he'll
PL: uncover his charade for a big story and finally goads him into a public

PL: Espionage casts a dark shadow across the 918th. The Nazis try psychological
PL: warfare by singling out Gen. Savage for assassination and then broadcasting
PL: a warning about the plot through radio propaganda with clues on how and
PL: when it might happen. The tactic works to a degree as suspicion runs

PL: point of being foolhardy. His audacity makes him the perfect candidate for
PL: a daring, potentially suicidal mission to bomb a German dam in a solo

PL: stellar training record, Cpl. Steve Corbett, is chafing at the bit to get
PL: into combat so he can kill some "krauts". On his first training mission,
PL: however, he panics when his gun jams, and Sgt. Komansky steps in to settle
PL: him down and teach him the ropes, which pleases Col. Gallagher because it
PL: is the first time Komansky has shown anything but a "me first" attitude.
PL: Unfortunately, Corbett's actions become even more erratic in subsequent

PL: Gen. Hoagland, a strictly by-the-book desk jockey, visits the 918th to

PL: lands hellbent on getting Savage fired. In an effort to show Hoagland the

PL: the unthinkable; Hoagland is killed in a manner that casts suspicion on

PL: accomplished through first-person narratives, descriptions of the
PL: executions, and the last statements of the leaders. Doing so allows viewers
PL: to understand the sea change that occurred in Ireland in the aftermath of
PL: the Rising. Contributors to the series will pose questions and analyze the
PL: significance of the events of Easter Week 1916-both in Ireland itself but
PL: also throughout the world. Finally, the legacy of the 1916 Irish Rebellion
PL: is analyzed and the question is explored how, still, it remains of
PL: significance to people worldwide.

PL: Great Britain, 1990. The population is now governed by an increasingly
PL: corrupt bureaucracy headed by the Home Secretary and backed by the
PL: tyrannical Public Control Department (PCD), who have done away with the
PL: rights of the individual and maintain control through ID cards, rationing,
PL: censorship and electronic/audio/physical surveillance. Free speech is
PL: forbidden. The rule of law no longer protects the weak and defenseless.
PL: Emigration is impossible. But escape is not, thanks to rebels like Jim Kyle
PL: ('Edward Woodward' (qv)), a journalist and secret dissident who battles the
PL: forces of the Establishment, but constantly faces imprisonment or death (or
PL: worse) at the hands of the PCD and its ruthless controller Herbert Skardon.

PL: and its ruthless Controller Herbert Skardon. However, Kyle's current

PL: Wainwright to the United States of America to promote their cause, the plan
PL: backfires disastrously when his speech is littered with dissident
PL: criticisms of the bureaucratic nightmare the United Kingdom has become
PL: under the stewardship. When he returns home, the PCD are quick to repay the
PL: compliment by sending him to an Adult Rehabilitation Centre, a place where
PL: offenders against the state (political activists, murderers, thieves, etc)
PL: are sent for "correction" under a combination of drug therapy and severe

PL: After the Kyle Trial fiasco, Skardon takes his revenge by turning Kyle into
PL: a Non-Citizen: stripping Kyle of his ID and Union cards, freezing his bank
PL: account and seizing all his assets. With no home, no car, no job, no money,
PL: only the clothes on his back and his family missing (and a bugged
PL: Non-Citizen ID card so the PCD can track him), Kyle is forced to wander the
PL: streets in what seems like a hopeless attempt to survive, especially when
PL: he is constantly and sadistically harassed by Skardon and Inspector
PL: Nichols. His only hope is that Dave Brett and black marketeer Sammy Calhoun

PL: plan to turn the heat up on the pair by employing a systematic campaign of

PL: "We always said there'd be Peace Crimes Trials one day ... We're winning
PL: now. There'll have to be a purge of the PCD soon." The dissident assault on
PL: the Public Control Department has been successful, but the public suicide
PL: of a cell member has resulted in world condemnation of Britain's policies
PL: and the PCD being plunged into bitter in-fighting. Have Kyle and the
PL: dissidents finally won? Will Skardon and the PCD fall for good, and if they

PL: despite the legitimacy of the claim. However, one judge, Philip Carter, is
PL: determined to fight the corrupt legal system and continually votes to
PL: uphold legitimate claims despite always being outvoted by the Chairperson
PL: and a weak-willed third judge. Angered by Carter's defiance, the Attorney
PL: General demands that Skardon and the PCD find a way to silence Carter. The
PL: PCD's plan: a campaign of threats and intimidation against Carter's
